## Project Details

### Tech Stack

I used React as the primary frontend library for building the application. Additionally, I leveraged bootstrap and styled components to enhance the development process.

### Development Approach

1. **Product Listing**: I began by creating components to display products with their images, names, prices, and "Add to Cart" buttons. I then implemented filters, allowing users to sort products by category, price range, or ratings.

2. **Shopping Cart**: I designed a cart section that displayed added products, their quantities, and the total cost. Users can easily adjust item quantities or remove items from the cart. I also ensured real-time updates of the cart total and item count.

3. **Checkout**: For the checkout process, I developed a feature that calculates the total cost of items in the cart. Users can provide shipping information and payment details for a seamless shopping experience.

4. **Responsive Design**: I made sure the website is responsive, guaranteeing a consistent and user-friendly experience on both desktop and mobile devices.


## Usage

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

```bash
npm start
```

## Acknowledgments
